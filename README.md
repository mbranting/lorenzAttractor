Included:
-------------------
this README, 
lorenzAttractor.py file, 
output from executing python file (two graphs modeling solution)

-------------------
Packages 
------------------
Install packages for 
- numpy 
Using pip (sudo apt install python-pip) 
Install numpy (pip install numpy or pip3 install numpy (depending on version of Python))
Verify numpy installation (pip show numpy / pip3 show numpy)
(program code includes importing the package -- import numpy as np)
- scipy
Using pip install scipy (pip install scipy)
- matplotlib
Using pip (pip install matplotlib)
(program code includes importing the package -- import matplotlib.pyplot as plt)
- odeint
(program code imports the package using scipy from scipy.integrate import odeint)
Import module timeit
- Import mplot3d from mpl_toolkits as well as Axes3D to import registers the 3D projection
- import timeit
Import module math to be able to run calculations
- import math 

------------------
Design Decisions & Project Issues
------------------
From the flowchart shown in the documentation, the code was modeled based on this layout.
The equations and steps for understanding the algorithm used can be seen further explained in
the documentation.
Initial values were also provided and can be seen implemented throughout the code. 


Various project issues that were encountered involved understanding the algorithms used,
and being able to successfully implement that. 

-------------------
Results 
-------------------
Running the code will result in:
- graph showing subplots modeling the equation for x(t), y(t) and z(t)
- 3D figure modeling the equations together
- Time to complete calculations for each approach
